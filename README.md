## Project Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is designed to replicate the core functionalities of Airbnb.  
It covers full-stack development, emphasizing backend architecture, database management, API security, and continuous integration/deployment practices.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Master GitHub collaborative workflows.
- Understand backend architecture and relational database design.
- Implement API security measures.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- Integrate Django, MySQL, and GraphQL effectively.

---

## Team Roles
- **Backend Developer:** Implements API endpoints, business logic, and server-side functionality.
- **Database Administrator:** Designs database schema, manages data, and ensures data integrity.
- **Frontend Developer:** Builds user interfaces and connects them to APIs.
- **DevOps Engineer:** Sets up CI/CD pipelines, Docker containers, and deployment processes.
- **QA Engineer:** Tests features, verifies functionality, and ensures quality standards.

## Technology Stack
- **Django:** Web framework to build RESTful APIs and handle server-side logic.
- **MySQL:** Relational database to store users, properties, bookings, reviews, and payments.
- **GraphQL:** API query language for flexible and efficient data retrieval.
- **Docker:** Containerization to ensure consistent environments across development and production.
- **GitHub Actions:** CI/CD tool to automate testing and deployment workflows.

## Database Design
**Entities:**
- **Users:** id, name, email, password; can have multiple bookings.
- **Properties:** id, title, description, price, host_id; belongs to a host.
- **Bookings:** id, user_id, property_id, check_in, check_out; belongs to a user and a property.
- **Reviews:** id, booking_id, rating, comment; tied to a booking.
- **Payments:** id, booking_id, amount, status; linked to bookings.

**Relationships:**
- A user can have multiple bookings.
- Each booking belongs to a single property.
- A property can have multiple reviews.
- Payments are associated with bookings.

## Feature Breakdown
- **User Management:** Sign up, login, profile editing, and authentication.
- **Property Management:** Create, update, and list properties for booking.
- **Booking System:** Users can book properties with selectable check-in/check-out dates.
- **Payment Processing:** Securely handle payment transactions for bookings.
- **Review System:** Users can leave ratings and feedback for booked properties.

## API Security
- **Authentication:** Verify user identities to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Authorization:** Restrict actions based on user roles and permissions.
- **Rate Limiting:** Protect the API from abuse and excessive requests.
- **Data Encryption:** Ensure sensitive data like passwords and payment info are secure.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment automates testing and deployment of the project:
- **Purpose:** Detect issues early, maintain code quality, and ensure smooth deployment.
- **Tools:** GitHub Actions for automated testing, Docker for containerization.
- **Benefits:** Faster development cycles, fewer deployment errors, consistent environments.
